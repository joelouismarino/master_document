\section{Intelligence}

Intelligence is a vaguely defined concept. In many situations, we often use the term to refer to the ability to perceive and understand certain concepts, such as math, art, politics, business, etc. But this narrow definition is human specific, ill-stated, and fails to capture the broad spectrum that intelligence occupies. Instead, use this working definition:

\begin{center}
	\textbf{Intelligence} is the ability of a system to perform meaningful actions within a particular environment.
\end{center}
